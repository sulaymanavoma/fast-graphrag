## Benchmarks
We validate the benchmark results provided in [HippoRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14831), as well as comparing with other methods:
- NaiveRAG using the embedder `text-embedding-3-small`
- [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) 
- [GraphRAG](https://github.com/gusye1234/nano-graphrag) (we use the implementation provided by `nano-graphrag`, based on the original [Microsoft GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag))

We also briefly report the insertion times for the 2wikimultihopqa benchmark (~800 chunks):
|  Method  |  Time (minutes)  |
|:--------:|-----------------:|
|  VectorDB|              ~0.3|
|  LightRAG|               ~25|
|  GraphRAG|               ~40|
|**Circlemind**|              ~1.5|

### Run it yourself
The scripts in this directory will generate and evaluate the 2wikimultihopqa datasets on a subsets of 51 and 101 queries with the same methodology as in the HippoRAG paper. In particular, we evaluate the retrieval capabilities of each method, mesauring the percentage of queries for which all the required evidence was retrieved. We preloaded the results so it is enough to run `evaluate.xx` to get the numbers. You can also run `create_dbs.xx` to regenerate the databases for the different methods.  
A couple of NOTES:
- you will need to set an OPENAI_API_KEY;
- LightRAG and GraphRAG could take a while (~1 hour) to process;
- when pip installing LightRAG, not all dependencies are added; to run it we simply deleted all the imports of each missing dependency (since we use OpenAI they are not necessary).
- we also benchmarked on the HotpotQA dataset (we will soon release the code for that as well).

The output should looks similar to the following (the exact numbers could vary based on your graph configuration)
