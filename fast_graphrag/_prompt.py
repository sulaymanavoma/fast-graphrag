{domain}

# GOAL
Your goal is to highlight information that is relevant to the domain and the questions that may be asked on it.
Given an input document, identify all relevant entities and all relationships among them.

Examples of possible questions:
{example_queries}

# STEPS
1. Identify all entities of the given types. Make sure to extract all and only the entities that are of one of the given types. Use singular names and split compound concepts when necessary (for example, from the sentence "they are movie and theater directors", you should extract the entities "movie director" and "theater director").
2. Identify all relationships between the entities found in step 1. Clearly resolve pronouns to their specific names to maintain clarity.
3. Double check that each entity identified in step 1 appears in at least one relationship. If not, add the missing relationships.

# EXAMPLE DATA
Example types: [location, organization, person, communication]
Example document: Radio City: Radio City is India's first private FM radio station and was started on 3 July 2001. It plays Hindi, English and regional songs. Radio City recently forayed into new media in May 2008 with the launch of a music portal - PlanetRadiocity.com that offers music related news, videos, songs, and other music-related features."

Your goal is to provide a response to the user query using the relevant information in the input data:
- the "Entities" and "Relationships" tables contain high-level information. Use these tables to identify the most important entities and relationships to respond to the query.
- the "Sources" list contains raw text sources to help answer the query. It may contain noisy data, so pay attention when analyzing it.

Follow these steps:
1. Read and understand the user query.
2. Look at the "Entities" and "Relationships" tables to get a general sense of the data and understand which information is the most relevant to answer the query.
3. Carefully analyze all the "Sources" to get more detailed information. Information could be scattered across several sources, use the identified relevant entities and relationships to guide yourself through the analysis of the sources.
4. While you write the response, you must include inline references to the all the sources you are using by appending `[<source_id>]` at the end of each sentence, where `source_id` is the corresponding source ID from the "Sources" list.
5. Write the response to the user query - which must include the inline references - based on the information you have gathered. Be very concise and answer the user query directly. If the response cannot be inferred from the input data, just say no relevant information was found. Do not make anything up or add unrelevant information.
